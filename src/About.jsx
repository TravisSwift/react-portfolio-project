        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a JavaScript-curious, front-end-leaning programmer, trying to function in the algorithmn 
        I enjoy building web applications, solving problems, and learning new technologies.

        I've been playing with code on and off since Netscape Composer made HTML so easy. Took a 10 year break and the advncements and changes are amazing. 

        <p>To learn more I have attended two programming boot camps, University of Texas Full Stack Developer Boot Camp and  Ancora College Web App Javascript Developer course.
            
            I have been told, if you keep at it long enough it will finally click. There has been no click yet and I am too far in to quit now! I will continue playing with code and seeing where it takes me.</p>

            <p> I would love to work with mobile games. As a long time PC and table top gamer (AD&D First Edition FTW!, Half-Life, Battlefield, Counter-Strike, and all three Baldur's Gates) it would be fun to be part of building someone's dream game.</p>

            <p>This portfolio is a collection of course work, code exporation, and various apps from tuorials and walk throughs. </p>
